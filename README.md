## Assignment 1 – Basic Python Concepts

### Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
File: `Assignment-1/basiccalsulations.py`

This program:
- Takes two numbers as input from the user
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Displays the result of each operation

Example:

```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10
Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5
```

### Task 2: Personalized Greeting
File: `Assignment-1/greeting.py`

This program:
- Accepts a user’s first and last name
- Combines them into a full name
- Displays a personalized greeting message

Example:

```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```

## Assignment 2 – Control Structures in Python

### Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
File: `Assignment-2/Even_odd.py`

This program:
- Takes an integer input
- Uses an if-else statement to determine if it is even or odd
- Prints the result

Example:

```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number
```

---

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
File: `Assignment-2/sum_of_first_50.py`

This program:
- Uses a for loop
- Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50
- Displays the final total

Example:

```
Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 1275
```
