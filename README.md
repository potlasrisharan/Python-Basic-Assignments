## Assignment 1 – Basic Python Concepts

### Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
File: `Assignment-1/basiccalsulations.py`

This program:
- Takes two numbers as input from the user
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Displays the result of each operation

Example:

```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10
Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5
```

---

### Task 2: Personalized Greeting
File: `Assignment-1/greeting.py`

This program:
- Accepts a user’s first and last name
- Combines them into a full name
- Displays a personalized greeting message

Example:

```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```

## Assignment 2 – Control Structures in Python

### Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
File: `Assignment-2/Even_odd.py`

This program:
- Takes an integer input
- Uses an if-else statement to determine if it is even or odd
- Prints the result

Example:

```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number
```

---

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
File: `Assignment-2/sum_of_first_50.py`

This program:
- Uses a for loop
- Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50
- Displays the final total

Example:

```
Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 1275
```

## Assignment 3 – Functions & Modules in Python 

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

File: Assignment-3/factorial_using_function.py 

This program:

Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as a "seed".

Uses recursion to calculate the factorial (multiplying a number by every number below it until it reaches 1).

Returns and prints the final calculated result.

Example:

Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
Task 2: Using the Math Module 

File: Assignment-3/math_module.py 

This program:

Asks the user for a single number.

Uses Python's built-in math module to do advanced "calculator" work.

Calculates the Square root, Natural logarithm, and Sine (in radians) of the number.

Displays all calculated results clearly.

Example:

Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/potlasrisharan/Python-Basic-Assignments.git
